# Linear-Regression---Ecommerce
Providing an ecommerce solution using Data Visualization techniques and Linear Regression

There is an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.

The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. 

To address this problem, I have chosen linear regression method

Before building my ML model, I am using various data visualization techniques to identify the features which have an effect on "Yearly Amount Spent"(Amount customers spend on their purchases).
